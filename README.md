# flutterapp


This is full Flutter app code that you can get and customize to your requirements.

In this project I incorporated with Flutter the following:


1- Parrallex U.I


2- GoRouter for pages navigation.


3- Google Map version 2.


4- Provider package.


6- Multi Locale .


And for the back end I used Supabase cloud platform for Postgresql database. You will find all the code for the app and the tables for the database.


    Features :

Implementing the Parrallax package which will improve the look of your pages images in your app

    Installation Instructions :


You need and IDE like Intellij , vscode or Android studio,


install the Flutter SDK and with it comes Dart language SDK.


Change & Adaptation of the code :


    IMPORTANT: You need to change things in the code like :


1- Your package name in the manifest and app name also in the build/gradle file.


2- Your URL & Secret key given to you by supabase and place in the main file.


3- Use your Google services key to make the Google Map works (kGoogleApiKey).


4- Use Your app key-store when you bundle the app to upload at play store , place the file at /app
